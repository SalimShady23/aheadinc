                                In 1991, <strong>AHEAD, Inc.</strong> achieved a major goal by bringing solar powered lights and refrigeration to 
                                the Rural Kishapu Village in Tanzania. The services of the Health Center were greatly improved and 
                                the nursed no longer had to use kersosene lamps or flashlights. In the year 2000, the residents of 
                                Meatu were introduced to Cookits, to enable the pasteurization of water in the rural areas.  
                                Similarly <strong>AHEAD, Inc.</strong> introduced Rocket stoves to 5 villages in The Gambia as a part of its mission to 
                                foster sustainable environmental activities.  Always at the forefront, our Founder, 
                                Dr. Irving C Williams, was awarded the Ashden Trust Award by Her Royal Highness Princess Anne, 
                                due to <strong>AHEAD, Inc’s</strong> commitment to protect the environment.

                                A sustainable infrastructure for the Maruku Health Center remains a daily unmet burden. 
                                As patient visits, usage, and demands at the Maruku campus has escalated, 
                                it has taxed the health centers fragile electrical system, proving it incapable of reliably 
                                powering the facility and compromising the ability to deliver safe and effect health care. 
                                Our founders Elvira and Irving Williams, after witnessing the electrical power limitations first 
                                hand during our AHEAD Health Fair in Maruku in July 2023, with the hospital generator shuttering 
                                then rebooting serially through each hour, they challenged the board of directors of AHEAD “to work 
                                with our volunteer partners to establish, for the health center, a reliable energy that is proven, 
                                cost-effective, replicable, and ecologically resourceful, that will improve health care 
                                delivery in Maruku and help save lives.” We ask that you help AHEAD meet this challenge, 
                                and support the AHEAD Inc. Solar Energy / Maruku Health Center Project.

                                An article in Reuters, on September 28, 2023 notes, 
                                “Maintenance issues and climate change-induced water shortages have 
                                caused an electricity shortfall in Tanzania triggering power rationing 
                                across the East African nation,” offering further that Tanzania's national 
                                grid  is suffering from “broken infrastructure.” Despite the government 
                                embarking on one of the fastest roll-outs of electricity access in Sub-Saharan 
                                Africa over the past decade, only 38% of Tanzanians have power, according to the 
                                World Bank.  Lack of access to affordably reliable electricity deprives millions 
                                of rural people of quality healthcare in developing countries. The situation is 
                                worse across rural Tanzania, where electricity coverage stands at less than 25 percent.  And yet, solar energy investments in Tanzania are still at a small scale
