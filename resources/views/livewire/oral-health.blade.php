                                Oral health is the missing link to a person's overall health. Research has shown that poor oral
                                health is linked to diabetes, heart attacks, stroke, lung disease, Alzheimerâ€™s disease, etc. Even
                                premature, low birth weight infants are linked to bacteria and infection in the mouth. Unfortunately,
                                most people do not visit the dentist until they have severe infection and their visit is only for pain
                                relief. Especially in rural communities, people rarely visit the dentist. Research has shown that
                                regular visits to the dentist can decrease chronic infection in your mouth and will reduce the incidences
                                of these co-morbidities. It would be truly a game changer to educate young boys and girls from an
                                early age to kniw about the importance of oral health.

                                The dental program program of AHEAD, Inc will ensure that young people from Maruku Secondary School and
                                neighboring schools receive oral exams and other preventive care, including dental cleanings and
                                necessary treatment. Students will visit twice a year for services. During their visit they will
                                receive oral health education and information on the role that nutrition and diet play in the
                                prevention of dental diseases, hence, impacting their total overall health. Students may even
                                develop an interest in working in the oral health field as a dentist, dental therapist, a lab technician,
                                or other health areas. Additionally other family members may be encouraged to seek routine
                                dental care.

                                Our 2024 plan includes having Maruku Secondary School students visit Maruku Health

                                & Oral Hygiene instructions/Oral Systemic Health Education.
                                We seek financial support for renovating a building designated by the Maruku
                                Health Center to place a complete dental office where our program will be
                                implemented.
