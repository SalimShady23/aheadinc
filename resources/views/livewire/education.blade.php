                                <strong>"We have proved beyond a doubt that the increase of computers in our IT program has contributed much to the increase in numbers of students and especially girls choosing Computer Studies”</strong>
                                emphasizes Mwalimu Farida Kamanyile, Headmistress of Maruku Secondary School. 
                                </strong>"As a result, absenteeism has decreased significantly in our schools with the fact that 
                                the students like to enter in the computer laboratory where by the subject itself attracts 
                                them to attend school daily. The computer donations have added a value into teaching code to teachers in which today 
                                they are able to get enough material resources from online resources all the time, 
                                and at the same time students benefit from the internet by retrieving different materials for their studies. 
                                These computers will help our students and teachers to have a wide scope and great awareness on the 
                                globalization issues where our youth will be able to compete in the global job competition.”</strong>

                                Since 1981, <strong>AHEAD, Inc.</strong> has supported numerous educational projects.  Some of the projects have included: 
                                scholarships for students, building dormitories for girls, providing electricity for schools; and donation of books and other educational materials, renovation of lavatories in the school, etc.
                                In addition to the computer project the youth in the village of Maruku, Tanzania lack recreational facilities to play individual and organized sports and lack many of the basic materials needed to meet the demands of a school day. 
                                Maruku Secondary School educates 897 teenage students: boys are 443 and girls are 454. The students come from very modest beginnings with extremely limited resources, lack a secure safety net, and many live with extreme poverty. 
                                Matriculation and retention remain a challenge, and while their aspirations may be lofty, too often students are overwhelmed by the challenges of poverty, paucity of resources, 
                                health and food insecurity, family demands, the undervaluing of girls, early marriage, and marginal opportunities, that preclude educational investment and success. Consequently, many children are challenged to excel in school, 
                                to remain physically active, create healthy life choices, and are without athletic outlets and team sports.

                                The solution is the construction of a multi-use outdoor basketball/volleyball court for the Maruku Secondary School, in Maruku, Bukoba District, Tanzania.  
                                Providing the youth of this community with a basketball/volleyball/multi-use athletic court and the access to engage and enjoy play, with an open, available, 
                                and reliable sports outlet, organized team sports opportunities, and life skills will establish a sustainable platform to help Maruku students become successful, while providing a welcoming space that facilitates 
                                healthy living through athletics; and it will serve to enrich the programming and provide needed infrastructure at the Maruku Secondary School and for the surrounding communities. Children will learn that education in 
                                conjunction with team sports for girls and boys will help their organizational skills, management skills, and social attitudes towards working together for the betterment of self and the community. 
                                Education coupled with the sport of basketball and volleyball promotes collaboration, teamwork, and critical thinking-all skills necessary for success. School sports participation is significantly associated with:
